## My process

I build this Home-page Website Project within 1 and half weeks along with my fellows (but each separately and differently), By doing this project we just finished the Ultimate HTML & CSS full course of Mosh Hamedani, which was quite helpful and interesting, and learned a lot of things.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- A little bit of JS

### What I learned

I practiced and learned all the topics that I learned and studied in this course, which was quite helpful. Also, I learned some mini - new topics that were not explained during the course.

### Continued development

By finishing this project my journey will not stop, yet It is getting started now. My Journey is going to be very long so After this I've a plan of building 50-100 other fundamental of HTML & CSS projects. So be ready...

### Useful resources

- [Mosh Hamedani](https://codewithmosh.com/) - I build this project upon the work of him and I am doing his courses currently, which really helped me a lot.
