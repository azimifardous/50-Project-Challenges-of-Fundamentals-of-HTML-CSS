          Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of
          Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later
          became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan,
          sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the
          international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity
          brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja —
          including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.
          Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
          complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in
          the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal
          shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Itachi was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha. His early
          childhood was marked with violence: when he was four years old, the
          Third Shinobi World War waged and he witnessed first-hand many of the
          war's casualties. The death and destruction he experienced at such a
          young age traumatised Itachi and made him a pacifist, leading to him
          training non-stop to achieve his dream of becoming a ninja among ninja
          in order to erase fighting from the world. At age 5, after becoming a
          big brother to Sasuke, Itachi was approached by Shisui, who offered to
          train together. Soon, the two became best friends, forming a
          brother-like bond as they continued to teach the other new tricks.
          During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, he was home alone looking
          after Sasuke, followed by Itachi rescuing Mikoto from falling debris,
          and in the anime seeking shelter with Izumi. The Nine-Tails' attack
          had soured relations between Konoha's leadership and the Uchiha, the
          former believing the latter to be responsible. The Uchiha were
          relocated to the edge of the village, isolating them from the rest of
          the village and making it easier to monitor them.<br />

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
          From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable
          maturity for his age and knowledge on how to deal with every
          situation. For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a
          rather humble man. Never arrogant about his own abilities nor
          underestimating others, most things he said would be unbiased and
          accurate. If an opponent exceeded his expectations or posed a
          legitimate challenge to him or his allies, Itachi would freely admit
          it. As a seven-year-old, his reasoning was on par with a Hokage.
          Having studied history, not just of his clan or his village but of the
          world, he gained a broader appreciation of what was important.
          Learning so much enabled him to understand how events of the past came
          to happen and, when he applied that same understanding into the
          future, he became concerned for where things were going. At the same
          time, Itachi was still fairly naïve as a child in many real-world
          scenarios and as such was willing to learn from his peers on how to
          differentiate situations. He lived at a distance, observing
          individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so that he
          could fully understand them.<br />

        <h2>Famous Quotes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            (To an infant Sasuke) "Don't cry, Sasuke. Your big brother is here
            to protect you, no matter what happens."
          </li>
          <li>
            (To Naruto) "You don't become the Hokage to be acknowledged by
            everyone. The one who is acknowledged by everyone becomes the
            Hokage."
          </li>
          <li>
            (Last words to Sasuke after reincarnation) "If I had been open with
            you from the start… and looked you straight in the eyes and told you
            the truth, then I wouldn't have had to stand before you, from above,
            as a failure, telling you all of this. So this time, I want to
            impart this truth to you… You don't ever have to forgive me. And no
            matter what you do from here on out, know this… I will love you
            always."
