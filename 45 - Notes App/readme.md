# Sticky Notes App

### The challenge

User should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Add item to the page
- Delete item from the page
- Edit texts
- Save the texts and edited ones

#### Tip
User is able to use any kind of markdowns to style his texts. For example:
*hello world* - Emphasize
**hello world** - Bold
- Item 1
  - Sub Item
- Item 2

...much more
